## ‚úÖ Key Cost Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Single NAT Gateway
- **Strategy**: Consolidated all private subnet egress traffic through a single NAT Gateway instead of one per Availability Zone.
- **Impact**: **Reduced NAT Gateway costs by 50%**, saving approximately **$45.60/month**. This is the most significant cost-saving measure in the architecture.

### 2. Provisioned EFS Throughput
- **Strategy**: Switched EFS from the default "Bursting" mode to "Provisioned" throughput, setting it to a baseline of **10 MiB/s**.
- **Impact**: Provides predictable performance at a fixed, lower cost (~$6.00/month) compared to the variable and potentially high costs of bursting credits. Ideal for consistent workloads.

### 3. Fargate Right-Sizing
- **Strategy**: Selected specific vCPU and Memory configurations for each service based on expected load (e.g., smaller instances for MLflow/TensorBoard).
- **Impact**: Prevents over-provisioning and ensures we only pay for the compute capacity we need.

### 4. EFS Intelligent-Tiering
- **Strategy**: Implemented a lifecycle policy to automatically move EFS files to the cost-effective Infrequent Access (IA) storage class after 30 days.
- **Impact**: Reduces storage costs for older, less-frequently-accessed experiment data by up to 92%.

## üí° Additional Cost Optimization Options

For projects with tighter budget constraints, the following optimizations can significantly reduce deployment costs:

### Potential Cost Reductions

| Optimization | Monthly Savings | Annual Savings | Impact |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Remove NAT Gateway** | ~$45.00 | ~$540.00 | Deploy in public subnets, store model weights on S3 instead of W&B model registry |
| **Replace EFS with S3** | ~$6.00 | ~$72.00 | Use S3 for experiment storage (slightly slower access) |
| **Use DockerHub instead of ECR** | ~$0.50 | ~$6.00 | Free public Docker registry |
| **Remove Route 53 DNS** | ~$1.50 | ~$18.00 | Use direct ALB endpoints instead of custom domains |
| **Switch to EC2** | ~$40.00 | ~$480.00 | For long-running deployments, EC2 instances are more cost-effective than Fargate |
| **Total Potential Savings** | **~$93.00** | **~$1,116.00** | **Optimized cost: ~$82.55/month** |

### Alternative Storage Options

- **MongoDB for Inference Results**: Use MongoDB for inference results and custom experiment metadata storage instead of file-based systems
- **S3-Only Storage**: Store all experiment data, logs, and artifacts directly in S3 with appropriate folder structure
- **Hybrid Approach**: Keep critical real-time data in EFS, archive older experiments to S3

### Performance vs Cost Trade-offs

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Considerations**:
- These optimizations may slightly impact system **stability**, **convenience**, and **performance**
- Public subnet deployment reduces security isolation
- S3 access is slower than EFS for frequent file operations
- EC2 instances require more management overhead than Fargate
- DockerHub has rate limits and less security than private ECR

**Recommendation**: For production environments, start with the current architecture. For development/testing or budget-constrained deployments, consider the optimized approach.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cost Monitoring & Alerts

It is critical to monitor costs to avoid unexpected charges.

- **AWS Budgets**: Set up a monthly cost budget for the entire account to receive alerts when spending exceeds predefined thresholds.
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Create alarms on specific high-cost metrics:
  - `NATGatewayAddressProcessedBytes`: To monitor data processing, which is the primary driver of NAT Gateway costs.
  - `ProvisionedThroughput`: For EFS, to ensure usage doesn't exceed the provisioned amount.
  - `CPUUtilization`: For ECS services, to help with right-sizing decisions.
